# Defender Douglas Game Design Document

Created by Team 6 - Ephi, Josh and Travis. 

# Design Goals

**Overview** - Defender Douglas is fast paced player vs player 'collectathon' where power jumps between players based on their stage of collection, each player's goal is to take the other out while collecting their respective collectable.

**Rationale** - Creating a cat and mouse style game where both players get a chance to experience both roles in one round. We started out designing a hide from the monster game but that had the problem of ending too quickly and linearly, when we saw the assets we saw the opportunity to make our idea more dynamic while filling the allotted 60 seconds, by making the power shift between the two players as they collect items.

**Objective Statement** - Create a competitive collection race where both players get a chance to be on the side of the power fantasy.

## Gameplay Goals

**Desired Gameplay** - One player chases the other for about 15-20 seconds, until they gain enough rats in order to turn the table, and chase the other player. At this point, the rat player has the agency, and the Doug player is likely to be on the defensive. Over the course of the round, keys spawn to open a gate, allowing Doug access to a rifle, at which point the agency switches back to Doug.

This mechanic effectively puts a gameplay time limit on the minigame, thematically. The rat only has so long to eat Doug. 

The randomized food spawn creates a scenario where every game is slightly different, forcing the rat to rethink their approach on repeated gameplay.

## Mechanics

**Douglas**
 - Bite to destroy one of the rats within his range.
 - Bark, to slow down the rats.
 - Keys - Collect 3 to get access to a firearm to quickly clear the screen of rats! Spawned over the course of the game and not all at once.

**Rat**
 - Stand next to Douglas to chip away at his health.
 - Eat food to create a rat follower to help you overpower Doug.
 - Get through small spaces that Doug cannot.

## Future of Defender Douglas

Down the line, additional spawn factors could be added, such as power up or time based food and heal spawning. This would add significant variants to the game mode, and are fairly low hanging development fruit, that would have a big impact. 

With an expansion beyond the 60 second time limit, there are a lot of additional things that could be added such as randomized round based augments and weapons.
Additionally, Defender Douglas can be evolved into an arcade style local multiplayer title. With different games and game modes centered around Douglas and other animals, Defender Douglas can be a standalone title. 

This minigame acts as a proving ground that "Defender Douglas" can act as a mascot character for a series of quick and fun arcade minigames.
